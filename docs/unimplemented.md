# Unimplemented features

This document lists features that are:
1) Not implemented currently.
2) Unplanned for unknown period of time.

For planned features, look at github project pages,
it contains several roadmaps.

* Complex numbers
* Reflection and `unsafe`
* Struct field tags (field associated strings)
* Channels (along with `close`, `select` and other related features)
* Init functions
* `go` statements

Features described here *may* be implemented one day,
but that day may be very far away from today.
